src/fdb.c:195:  [5] (buffer) strncat:
  Easily used incorrectly (e.g., incorrectly computing the correct
  maximum size to add). Consider strlcat or automatically resizing strings.
  Risk is high; the length parameter appears to be a constant, instead of
  computing the number of characters left.
src/fdb.c:48:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be overflowed. Perform bounds checking,
  use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than
  the maximum possible length.
